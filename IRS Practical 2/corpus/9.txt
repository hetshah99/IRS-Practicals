If a cheque reaches the bank in a torn condition, it is called a mutilated cheque. If the cheque is torn into two or more pieces and the relevant information is torn, the bank shall reject the cheque and declare it invalid, until the drawer confirms its validation. If the cheque is torn from the corners and all the important data on the cheque is intact, then the bank may process the cheque further.
